            <h1>The Beginning of Mayhem</h1>
            <p>For starters l introduce a crazy,confusing
                question to every reader of this article ,"Who thinks teenage life 
                would be that complex from the day he/she started high school?"If you say yes you might
                be right but there are those infinitesimal changes that are just unpredictable.These moments 
                are the ones that tell us there is something big that the Almighty is preparing us for , in
                short it is Adulthood and its defying obstacles.You can never predict the future or what you plan 
                to do in life  and you meet disappointments and broken dreams in your way.Dream! Dream! Dream!
                This is the only word that a teenager relies on through the journey, but some dreams just never 
                come true , Why?Is it because l'm cursed, l'm not doing enough "maybe" or l'm just incompetent.
                These are some of the thoughts that rush through our minds when we get disappointed with failures
                of not shaping those dreams.But these are just thoughts of dissapointments, theres an easy and 
                simple solution to those mistakes.The main thing to do is not to give up and go back to the 
                drawing board , reshape the dream and choose another angle to the goal post.Yes! l know that
                you might say l sound plain , but trust me take your pen and paper and start writing those 
                dreams and even shouting out loud !!!.<br><b>Mayhem|Mei.hem</b> is a term that describes the situation of great confusion,disorder,trouble and chaos.The is just the beginnings of an unplanned dream and faith without direction.Yes they tell you , to have Faith,Dream Big , Courageous and blah blah ..... But they never tell you to take a pause and ponder on the dreams that you artistically fashion to be realistic.Chaos begins when you regret the dreams and choices you make in life ?The only thing l can tell you is , regrets are a deadly virus that can infect the brain and unborn future choices.This tarnishes the image of hope and faith.No dream is big or small but it is how you plan to execute it [that is what matters most] and the resources including time that matter.The best thing to win a dream is simply Pausing , Breaking and Resetting the tune.
                <br><b>All l can say to you is always stay positive and live life to the full.</b>
