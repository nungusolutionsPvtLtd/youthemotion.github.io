            <h1>Negative Peer Pressure</h1>
            <p>Have you ever done anything horrible or gotten into a lot of trouble, 
                then felt guilty afterwards and thought, "I wish I never did this"?
                Negative peer pressure has destroyed careers and has devastated a lot of young people.<br><br>
                Peer pressure is defined as the incitement or influence of one's peers.
                The difficult thing about peer pressure is that anyone might be susceptible to this 
                social ill.
                Living in a volatile society might push you into precarious situations that could 
                jeopardize your future plans or you.The reason why we get dragged into these positions is because 
                we feel that we lack the status,or what I like to call social superpowers, 
                that we believe make us eminent.
                Join the elite crew and get to experience the benefits of notoriety,
                influence, power, and even immunity is the mandate that will severely impair your life.<br><br>
                The l wanna be effect! The problem starts when you feel that your soul is empty. 
                If you feel that you are very confident in yourself and you whole heartedly know yourself
                the social forces that impact us all will not take effect at all.
                Teenage life is not easy, and the situations that present themselves are 
                the ones we dare to take on if we are truly committed to realizing the dreams we
                have set for ourselves.
                The reason why you cannot resist the temptation or thirst is because of the circles
                you surround yourself with .Try as much as possible to surround yourself with the
                people that give a wow! Effect to your life or those that give you the chance to 
                inherit positive attributes from them.
                Yes l know the “pressure” is too much but if you feel and hear the voice! 
                In your conscience then know that you likely to regret somehow the after product.
                <br><br><b>
                Be proud of who you are! Be confident! Be bold! Be brave! Be responsible!
                Know who you are, the inner you and shape your dreams not negative forces to shape you.
                Know your worth.</b>
