            <h1>Your'e Annoying</h1>
            <br>
            <p>First of all, let’s remove the negative energy and embrace ourselves.<br><br>
                Say it out loud in your mind 
                <b>(“  l’m brave , l’m proud , l’m thankful and happy for myself” )</b> three times to be precise.<br><br>
                Writing this article for you is somehow a platform to share challenges that
                people might face as you navigate through your youth life.
                Have you been feeling unwanted or an enemy of the whole crowd because of your
                 decisions, what you feel, because you always want to be on the right side of things, 
                 or just because people aren’t interested in what you offer or your character? People scold you 
                 and always talk about you behind your back. Well, a lot can be said about these feelings, and they 
                 all circle around the issue of being unwanted. That’s right; that’s how you feel.<br><br>
                So many questions circle in your mind, and you always think, “But why can’t we just be 
                the same, feel the same, and flow together the same?" We are not that different after all!<br><br>
                Yes, I am aware that this sensation can lead to extreme mental strain and stress, 
                both of which are detrimental.You always process and think that all places you are
                 should be somehow safe havens for unwinding, enjoyment, and tranquility. However,
                 you are constantly uncomfortable here, and these locations are becoming hellish.<br><br>
                All I can say for now is that running away from those problems is not the solution. 
                Even if they are that intimidating and they are impairing your social, mental, and
                physical performance, Tell you what? These things happen everywhere, and you are not alone.
                The best way to tackle these situations is to try to create safe spaces that make you feel yourself.
                You should start learning to feel comfortable in your own company. Be proud of yourself and
                confident in things you feel are right for you.<br><br>
                Have confidence in the things you feel are correct for you and be proud of who you are.
                Take a seat, clear your mind, and consider the reasons behind your perceptions of others'
                hate for you. Our innate tendencies compel us to do some things that make people uncomfortable. 
                Trying to pay attention to what people are saying about you and finding ways to make things is 
                the best course of action.<br><br>
                Tell you what, even if they really are so terrifying and they are impairing your social,
                mental, and physical functioning? These are the things that humanize and elucidate you.
                People's social interactions are fascinating, and the greatest approach to establish a connection
                with them is to show who we truly are to them rather than pretending to be someone we're not, 
                since this can backfire badly. It may sound funny, but if you pretend to be someone you're not, 
                ultimately the secret will be revealed and you could end up ruined. Enjoy the person you are!<br><br>
                I’m saying this for the second time. Know who you are! There’s no gift that the universe can grant 
                you more than your individuality.<br><br>
                People frequently utter what they want about characters that appear in their lives, and you might 
                feel intimidated by what they say.<br><br>
                I'll tell you what, you'll be unstoppable if you try to ignore other people's opinions and adopt 
                a "I don't care" attitude. They are persons who deride others for a living, but words will ultimately
                be meaningless if you demonstrate to them the strength of your castle and your own self-worth.
                Know your value and aim for the target.<br><br>
                I always enjoy how in the animated movie Moana, she faces many forces that destroy her dreams,
                but her grandma asks her, “Moanaaa! Do you know who you are?“ and everything changed.<br><br>
                The crisis of mental bullying is there in different spaces, and I know that you may say you want 
                to change the environment to feel much better, but tell you what? Running away from problems is 
                not the solution at all. There are many ways to solve these challenges, apart from a few I have 
                mentioned, but the main thing I leave you to grasp is, (reader), do you know who you are?
